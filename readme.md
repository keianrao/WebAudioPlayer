Another tiny Vue.js app. Custom controls, including a local file input, interface with an in-memory &lt;audio&gt; element.

![At page top, a long "open local audio file" button. Below it, a small inset player panel, containing a timestamp label, a slider, then a small stop button, and a large pause button beside it. The stop button and pause button only have graphic icons.](screenshot.png)
